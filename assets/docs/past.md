How about H3?  Back in 2010 I worked on grids very similar to H3, while examining the âˆš7 rotation of each 
level of the hierarchy leading to an approximate correspondence along the edges.

However, I didn't like the ragged-edge issues that this sort of rotated hexgrid introduces and, again, 
the entire grid is oriented at each level of the hierarchy. It works well enough for one or two layers, but it does 
not easily allow fine resolution - nor is it easy (when in a ragged edge) to work out it's hierarchy.

So I gave up on that, and more recently worked on this half-hexagon solution.
